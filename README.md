# iOS-Personal-Finance-Manager-monthly-tracker-App
iOS Personal Finance Manager App
Tech Stack: Swift, SwiftUI, CoreData, REST APIs, Firebase Authentication (Optional)
Description:
This project will demonstrate your ability to manage data, work with local storage, and integrate modern UI frameworks like SwiftUI, while showcasing your problem-solving abilities in real-world scenarios.

Features:

Expense Tracking:
Users can log daily expenses and categorize them (e.g., food, travel, entertainment).
Provide real-time budget management with expense breakdown by category.
Income Management:
Track income sources, salary, or freelance payments.
Provide financial insights and suggest budgeting improvements.
Data Visualization:
Use SwiftUI to create beautiful, interactive graphs showing monthly spending trends and savings progress.
Pie charts to visualize expenses by category.
API Integration:
Integrate with a financial API (like Plaid API or any open financial API) to fetch real-time bank transactions.
CoreData Integration:
Use CoreData to store user’s data locally for offline access.
Authentication:
(Optional) Use Firebase Authentication for secure login/sign-up, ensuring user privacy.
Notifications:
Send reminders for recurring bills or when a user is approaching their monthly budget limit.
What to Showcase:

SwiftUI: Modern declarative UI framework to build fluid, responsive, and beautiful interfaces.
CoreData: Persistent data storage, allowing users to access their financial information offline.
API Integration: Working with external services to fetch real-time financial data.
Firebase Authentication: Adding secure authentication will show you're capable of creating complete, secure mobile apps.
Clean Code & Architecture: Following MVC or MVVM design patterns for maintainable, scalable code.
Why This Project Stands Out on Your Resume:
Problem-Solving: It addresses real-world challenges like financial management, which makes the project relatable and practical.
SwiftUI Expertise: Demonstrates your ability to work with the latest iOS development tools.
Full-Stack Development: If you integrate Firebase, it shows that you’re comfortable working on both the frontend (UI) and backend (authentication, data management).
Complexity & Impact: This app covers multiple aspects of development: data storage, API integration, secure user authentication, and data visualization—giving you a well-rounded project to discuss during interviews.
